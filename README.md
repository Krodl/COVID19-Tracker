# COVID19-Tracker
COVID19 confirmed cases tracker within the U.S using Spring Boot. Followed a YouTube video that showed the cases world-wide and I wanted to switch it up by doing it for the U.S. 
How the data was parsed from the Github repo, I had to write some methods to add together the values for multiple states so that the data showed up properly.
